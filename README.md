This is a interactive map for Bless Unleashed
https://hexcoded.github.io/BlessOriginsMap/


Instructions to add items
1. Click/create a temp marker where said item should be
2. Copy the formated location data in the popup for said marker
3. Paste said data into the index.html under the correct category(MAKE SURE IF YOU ARE ADDING MULTIPLE ITEMS THERE IS A "," BETWEEN THEM)
4. save/push said item back to the repository


Can i add another category to the map? 
yes, just make sure its in the correct format(check the index.html to see the format needed)

need to update the map with new areas?
i used a tool(bash script) called maptiles its on github and is also in the "/Map" directory 
it will be easier to edit the image i used(also in the /Map directory) and add said area to it then generate a new map to upload if said map addition dosent change the height/width of the current map

you will have to figure out the offset and update said coords of each marker
